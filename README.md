# TechTogether2020
Hackathon project for TechTogether Boston 2020.

The purpose of this program is teach financial literacy through playing a game.  In the game, you start with $100.  If you are able to answer a series of 25 questions correctly, you get to keep the money you started with.  For every question you miss, you lose $4.  You will also be shown a link so you can learn about the topic you missed.  The questions are broken down into five categories:  budgeting and setting financial goals; paying bills, taxes, and saving money; loans; credit; and investing, 401(k)s and stocks.

To run the program, open up main.py and run it in the console.
